# CataWiki Playwright Testing Framework

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a **clean, extensible Playwright UI testing framework** built for the CataWiki auction platform.

The focus of this README is **Playwright-based test automation**: structure, patterns, and scalability.  
Details about AI tooling and experimentation have been intentionally moved to a separate document (see `README2_AI.md`).

While the framework is UI-first, it is designed to *observe and document* the system under test in a way that supports future expansion, including service discovery and AI-assisted test generation, without coupling tests tightly to UI implementation details.

---

## Goals of This Framework

The goal of this exercise is **not full coverage**, but to demonstrate how a Playwright framework can scale cleanly over time and remain understandable to humans while being extensible by automation tooling.

Key goals:

- Provide a stable, working example of UI automation
- Demonstrate clear separation of concerns
- Enable easy addition of new test cases
- Support data-driven and maintainable test design
- Prepare for future test expansion without overengineering
- Provided a safe extenadble framework humans and AI can read

**Tech Stack:**  
Human testers · Playwright · TypeScript

## Implemented Test Scenarios

### Example User Journey – UI

**File:** `tests/smoke/train_flow.spec.ts`

Demonstrates a complete user journey:

1. Open CataWiki homepage
2. Search for the keyword **"train"**
3. Verify the results page loads
4. Open a specific lot
5. Validate the lot detail page
6. Log key details to the console:

   * Lot name
   * Favorites count
   * Current bid

This test prioritizes **clarity and debuggability** over exhaustive validation. It was used to set patterns for `tests/smoke/train_flow_v2.spec.ts` which adds more flexibility and consumes JSON test objects. 

---

### Page Object Model Validation

**File:** `tests/pages-pom.spec.ts`

Validates the Page Object abstraction:

* `HomePage.search()` using stable selectors
* `SearchResultsPage` navigation by index
* `LotPage.getLotDetails()` data extraction

Run with:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/pages-pom.spec.ts --headed
```

---

### Data-Driven UI Tests

**File:** `tests/ui/train_flow_v2.spec.ts`

Demonstrates scalable test design using Page Objects and JSON test data.

**Key characteristics:**

* Multiple test cases loaded from JSON
* Different search keywords and lot indices
* Soft assertions for richer feedback
* Stable test logic with growing coverage

Run with:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/ui/train_flow_v2.spec.ts --headed
```

---

## Accessibility Testing (A11y)

**File:** `tests/ui/accessibility.spec.ts`

Comprehensive accessibility compliance testing using axe-core integration:

### Features

* **WCAG 2.0/2.1 AA compliance checking** across key user journeys
* **Color contrast analysis** with specific ratio measurements
* **Keyboard navigation testing** for all interactive elements  
* **Screen reader compatibility** validation
* **Form and input accessibility** assessment
* **Detailed violation reporting** with remediation guidance

### Sample Analysis Output

```
📊 ACCESSIBILITY SUMMARY FOR CATAWIKI:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Total Violations: 12
Total Passes: 51

Breakdown by Severity:
  🔴 Critical: 4
  🟠 Serious: 5  
  🟡 Moderate: 3
  🔵 Minor: 0
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Key Capabilities

* **Homepage accessibility analysis** - Full WCAG audit of main page
* **Search results validation** - Accessibility of dynamic content
* **Color contrast detection** - Identifies specific failing color combinations
* **Keyboard navigation assessment** - Tab order and focus management
* **Screen reader compatibility** - ARIA landmarks and semantic structure
* **Comprehensive reporting** - JSON attachments with detailed violation data

Run with:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/ui/accessibility.spec.ts --headed --workers=1
```

**Note:** This test reports accessibility issues for improvement rather than failing on existing gaps, making it practical for continuous compliance monitoring.

---

## Data-Driven Test Design

Test cases are defined in structured JSON files and loaded dynamically.

### Example (`trainFlowCases.json`)

```json
{
  "cases": [
    {
      "description": "Train search - First lot",
      "keyword": "train",
      "lotIndex": 0,
      "expectedMinResults": 10
    },
    {
      "description": "Watch search - Third lot",
      "keyword": "watch",
      "lotIndex": 2,
      "expectedMinResults": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### Why This Matters

* Humans can easily add or review test cases
* Test logic remains unchanged as coverage grows
* Page Objects absorb UI changes
* Clear separation between **test intent** and **test implementation**

---

## Service Discovery (UI-Driven)

Although this repository focuses on UI automation, it also demonstrates how backend services can be **observed and documented** during real user flows.

### Approach

* Intercept XHR / `fetch` requests
* Log endpoints, response status, and timing
* Capture artifacts for later analysis

Artifacts are stored under:

```
src/discovery/
```

This enables future work such as API tests, contract validation, and UI–backend consistency checks.

---

## Cross-Browser & Mobile Support

The framework is designed to support:

* Chromium (enabled for this POC)
* Firefox
* WebKit (Safari-like)
* Mobile emulation

The same test logic can be reused across platforms with minimal configuration.

---

## Design Principles

* Readable tests over clever abstractions
* Page Objects for UI stability
* Minimal abstraction added only when needed
* Deterministic setup and teardown
* **Intentionally shallow, but structurally sound**

---

## Known Limitations (Intentional)

The following are planned but not implemented to keep the scope focused:

* Full CI/CD pipeline
* Visual regression testing
* Cross-browser execution in CI
* Advanced reporting dashboards
* Test data lifecycle management

These are considered **next steps**, not omissions.

---

## Summary

This repository demonstrates:

* A clean, maintainable Playwright setup
* Realistic UI automation examples
* Data-driven test design
* Page Object Model validation
* UI-driven service discovery
* A clear path to scale without rewriting tests

The framework is intentionally designed to be **extended, not replaced**, as coverage and tooling evolve.
